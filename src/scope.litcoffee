The **Scope** class regulates lexical scoping within CoffeeScript. As you
generate code, you create a tree of scopes in the same shape as the nested
function bodies. Each scope knows about the variables declared within it,
and has a reference to its parent enclosing scope. In this way, we know which
variables are new and need to be declared with `var`, and which are shared
with external scopes.

    exports.Scope = class Scope

Initialize a scope with its parent, for lookups up the chain,
as well as a reference to the **Block** node it belongs to, which is
where it should declare its variables, a reference to the function that
it belongs to, and a list of variables referenced in the source code scope
and therefore should be avoided when generating variables. Also track comments
that should be output as part of variable declarations.

      constructor: (@parent, @expressions, @method, @referencedVars) ->
        @variables = [{name: 'arguments', type: 'arguments'}]
        @comments  = {}
        @positions = {}
        @utilities = {} unless @parent

The `@root` is the top-level **Scope** object for a given file.

        @root = @parent?.root ? this

Adds a new variable or overrides an existing one.

      add: (name, type, immediate) ->
        return @parent.add name, type, immediate if @shared and not immediate
        if Object::hasOwnProperty.call @positions, name
          @variables[@positions[name]].type = type
        else
          @positions[name] = @variables.push({name, type}) - 1

When `super` is called, we need to find the name of the current method we're
in, so that we know how to invoke the same method of the parent class. This
can get complicated if super is being called from an inner function.
`namedMethod` will walk up the scope tree until it either finds the first
function object that has a name filled in, or bottoms out.

      namedMethod: ->
        return @method if @method?.name or !@parent
        @parent.namedMethod()

Look up a variable name in lexical scope, and declare it if it does not
already exist.

      find: (name, type = 'var') ->
        return yes if @check name
        @add name, type
        no

Reserve a variable name as originating from a function parameter for this
scope. No `var` required for internal references.

      parameter: (name) ->
        return if @shared and @parent.check name, yes
        @add name, 'param'

Just check to see if a variable has already been declared, without reserving,
walks up to the root scope.

      check: (name) ->
        !!(@type(name) or @parent?.check(name))

Generate a temporary variable name at the given index.

      temporary: (name, index, single=false) ->
        if single
          startCode = name.charCodeAt(0)
          endCode = 'z'.charCodeAt(0)
          diff = endCode - startCode
          newCode = startCode + index % (diff + 1)
          letter = String.fromCharCode(newCode)
          num = index // (diff + 1)
          "#{letter}#{num or ''}"
        else
          "#{name}#{index or ''}"

Gets the type of a variable.

      type: (name) ->
        return v.type for v in @variables when v.name is name
        null

If we need to store an intermediate result, find an available name for a
compiler-generated variable. `_var`, `_var2`, and so on...

      freeVariable: (name, options={}) ->
        index = 0
        loop
          temp = @temporary name, index, options.single
          break unless @check(temp) or @referencedVars.has(temp) or
            @shared and @parent.referencedVars.has(temp)
          index++
        @add temp, 'var', yes if options.reserve ? true
        temp

Ensure that an assignment is made at the top of this scope
(or at the top-level scope, if requested).

      assign: (name, value) ->
        @add name, {value, assigned: yes}, yes
        @hasAssignments = yes

Does this scope have any declared variables?

      hasDeclarations: ->
        !!@declaredVariables().length

Return the list of variables first declared in this scope.

      declaredVariables: ->
        (v.name for v in @variables when v.type is 'var').sort()

Return the list of assignments that are supposed to be made at the top
of this scope.

      assignedVariables: ->
        "#{v.name} = #{v.type.value}" for v in @variables when v.type.assigned
