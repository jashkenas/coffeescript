*   Object splats can now include prototype shorthands, such as `a = {b::c...}`; and soaks, such as `a = {b?.c..., d?()...}`.
*   Bugfix for regression in 2.5.0 where compilation became much slower for files with Windows-style line endings.
*   Bugfix for an implicit object after a line continuation keyword like `or` inside a larger implicit object.
