```

*   The syntax `import.meta`, including `import.meta.url`, is now supported.
*   The `await` keyword is now supported outside of functions (in other words, at the top level). [Note that JavaScript runtimes only support this for ES modules.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await)
*   Bugfix for a `for` comprehension at the end of an `unless` or `until` line.
