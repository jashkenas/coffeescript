*   The `coffeescript` package itself now supports named exports when used by ES modules in Node.js; or in other words, `import { compile } from 'coffeescript'` now works, rather than only `import CoffeeScript from 'coffeescript'`.
*   Bugfix for a stack overflow error when compiling large files in non-bare mode.
