*   [The CoffeeScript Wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki)<br>
    If you’ve ever learned a neat CoffeeScript tip or trick, or ran into a gotcha — share it on the wiki. The wiki also serves as a directory of handy [text editor extensions](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/Text-editor-plugins), [web framework plugins](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/Web-framework-plugins), and general [CoffeeScript build tools](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/Build-tools).
*   [The FAQ](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/FAQ)<br>
    Perhaps your CoffeeScript-related question has been asked before. Check the FAQ first.
*   [JS2Coffee](http://js2.coffee/)<br>
    Is a very well done reverse JavaScript-to-CoffeeScript compiler. It’s not going to be perfect (infer what your JavaScript classes are, when you need bound functions, and so on…) — but it’s a great starting point for converting simple scripts.
*   [High-Rez Logo](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/tree/master/documentation/site)<br>
    The CoffeeScript logo is available in SVG for use in presentations.
