### Command Line

Once installed, you should have access to the `coffee` command, which can execute scripts, compile `.coffee` files into `.js`, and provide an interactive REPL. The `coffee` command takes the following options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-c, --compile` | Compile a `.coffee` script into a `.js` JavaScript file of the same name. |
| `-t, --transpile` | Pipe the CoffeeScript compiler’s output through Babel before saving or running the generated JavaScript. Requires `@babel/core` to be installed, and options to pass to Babel in a `.babelrc` file or a `package.json` with a `babel` key in the path of the file or folder to be compiled. See [Transpilation](#transpilation).
| `-m, --map` | Generate source maps alongside the compiled JavaScript files. Adds `sourceMappingURL` directives to the JavaScript as well. |
| `-M, --inline-map` | Just like `--map`, but include the source map directly in the compiled JavaScript files, rather than in a separate file. |
| `-i, --interactive` | Launch an interactive CoffeeScript session to try short snippets. Identical to calling `coffee` with no arguments. |
| `-o, --output [DIR]` | Write out all compiled JavaScript files into the specified directory. Use in conjunction with `--compile` or `--watch`. |
| `-w, --watch` | Watch files for changes, rerunning the specified command when any file is updated. |
| `-p, --print` | Instead of writing out the JavaScript as a file, print it directly to **stdout**. |
| `-s, --stdio` | Pipe in CoffeeScript to STDIN and get back JavaScript over STDOUT. Good for use with processes written in other languages. An example:<br>`cat src/cake.coffee | coffee -sc` |
| `-l, --literate` | Parses the code as Literate CoffeeScript. You only need to specify this when passing in code directly over **stdio**, or using some sort of extension-less file name. |
| `-e, --eval` | Compile and print a little snippet of CoffeeScript directly from the command line. For example:<br>`coffee -e "console.log num for num in [10..1]"` |
| `-r, --require [MODULE]`&emsp; | `require()` the given module before starting the REPL or evaluating the code given with the `--eval` flag. |
| `-b, --bare` | Compile the JavaScript without the [top-level function safety wrapper](#lexical-scope). |
| `--no-header` | Suppress the “Generated by CoffeeScript” header. |
| `--nodejs` | The `node` executable has some useful options you can set, such as `--debug`, `--debug-brk`, `--max-stack-size`, and `--expose-gc`. Use this flag to forward options directly to Node.js. To pass multiple flags, use `--nodejs` multiple times. |
| `--ast` | Generate an abstract syntax tree of nodes of the CoffeeScript. Used for integrating with JavaScript build tools. |
| `--tokens` | Instead of parsing the CoffeeScript, just lex it, and print out the token stream. Used for debugging the compiler. |
| `-n, --nodes` | Instead of compiling the CoffeeScript, just lex and parse it, and print out the parse tree. Used for debugging the compiler. |

#### Examples:

*   Compile a directory tree of `.coffee` files in `src` into a parallel tree of `.js` files in `lib`:<br>
    `coffee --compile --output lib/ src/`
*   Watch a file for changes, and recompile it every time the file is saved:<br>
    `coffee --watch --compile experimental.coffee`
*   Concatenate a list of files into a single script:<br>
    `coffee --join project.js --compile src/*.coffee`
*   Print out the compiled JS from a one-liner:<br>
    `coffee -bpe "alert i for i in [0..10]"`
*   All together now, watch and recompile an entire project as you work on it:<br>
    `coffee -o lib/ -cw src/`
*   Start the CoffeeScript REPL (`Ctrl-D` to exit, `Ctrl-V`for multi-line):<br>
    `coffee`
